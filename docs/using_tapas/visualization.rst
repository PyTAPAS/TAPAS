Visualization
-------------

In the **Visualization** tab, users create publication-quality figures, including 2D contour maps, ΔA spectral and kinetic slices, and specialized plots for local and global fits. 
Graphical attributes including colors, axis limits and scales, legends, normalizations, figure sizes, and fonts can be adjusted interactively or via Matplotlib’s ``rcParams``. Complete ``matplotlibrc`` files may be loaded to match journal styles.  
Figures export to vector formats (PDF, SVG) or raster images (JPG, PNG, TIFF), and underlying data can be saved as CSV for use in external graphic tools.
