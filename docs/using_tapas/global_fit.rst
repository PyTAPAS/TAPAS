Global Fit
----------

The **Global Fit** tab extends local fitting across the full timeâ€“wavelength matrix.  
In addition to the Local Fit options, users may include a ground-state recovery term (optionally constrained by an external steady-state spectrum), apply wavelength-dependent weighting, and preview the kinetic scheme diagram.  
A global fit produces decay-associated spectra (DAS) and evolution-associated spectra (EAS), or species-associated spectra (SAS) when using a target model, along with concentration profiles, a residual map, and the SVD of residuals.  
Fit parameters are reported with absolute and relative standard errors, plus a summary of fit quality, parameter correlations, and stability diagnostics.  Optional MCMC-based Bayesian exploration reveals parameter asymmetries or multimodality beyond first-order error estimates.
Results can be saved back to the dataset and forwarded to the Visualization tab.
