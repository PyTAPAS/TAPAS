Component Analysis
------------------

The **Component Analysis** tab performs singular-value decomposition (SVD) on the TA matrix, extracts the leading principal components, and displays the normalized singular‚Äêvalue spectrum. It also shows the associated spectral and temporal eigenvectors and the residual surface after reconstructing with a user-selected number of components.
