Component Analysis
------------------

The **Component Analysis** tab performs singular-value decomposition (SVD) on the TA matrix, extracts the leading principal components, and displays the normalized singular‐value spectrum. It also shows the associated spectral and temporal eigenvectors and the residual surface after reconstructing with a user-selected number of components.


- **Dataset Widget**

  select the dataset to which the processing should be applied. 

- **Principal Components**

  Set the number of leading singular components which will be calculated and plotted. 

- **View Manipulations Widget**

  Set a delay-time (eg. 2ps, 2e-12, 2µs) where the delay-time axis should switch from a linear to a logarithmic time-scale.
